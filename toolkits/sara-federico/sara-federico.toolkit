and using <Antigen (https://antigen.sharats.me)> to bundle useful packages.

I have a pretty intense zshrc file, which you can <check out (https://github.com/gretzky/zshrc)>

> Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com)>
Diehard VSCode fangirl. Made the switch from Sublime Text after I realized how awesome IDE's are.

Running the <One Dark Pro (https://binaryify.github.io/OneDark-Pro/#/)> theme and using 14px <Hack (http://sourcefoundry.org/hack/)> font. The icons are from <Material (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme)>

> Sketch (https://www.sketchapp.com/)
 I use this every day to mockup and wireframe front end components. I'm also managing our app's react-sketchapp repo based off of <airbnb's open source tool (http://airbnb.io/react-sketchapp>

> Pikka (http://www.quotleapp.com/pikka/)
Super useful eyedropper tool and color organizer

Work communication!

> Alfred (https://www.alfredapp.com)
Better, faster, more robust spotlight

-- Frontend Development

My current day to day is mostly around building React components, as well as creating mockups and working with some hardware integration.

> Chrome (https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html)
My go-to browser for everything

> Webpack (https://webpack.js.org)
I have no idea how I bundled anything before it.

> Babel (https://babeljs.io)
I have no idea how I wrote js before it.

> Sass (https://sass-lang.com)
I have no idea how I wrote css before it.

> ESLint (https://eslint.org/)
My code would be a hot mess without it.

> ⚛️ React (https://facebook.github.io/react/)
Self explanatory.

-- Backend Development
Sometimes I dabble in some backend development- a lot of it with my own projects and past projects.

> Node.js & Express
At work and for my side projects, I use the <MERN (http://mern.io/)> stack.

> MongoDB (https://www.mongodb.com/)
Yay NoSQL!


-- Electronics
I mess around a lot with raspberry pi, arduino, and any other piece of hardware I can make do something. A part of my job is playing with sensors, and that carries over at home too where I'm knee-deep in home automation.

> Shell & UNIX
I'd say this is the stuff I've known the longest. It's extremely handy.

> C
Arduino has its own language which is just a set of C functions, but I found it was useful to learn more of C to understand wtf I was doing

> Python
Get yourself a $30 raspi and learn it. Seriously, worth it

> OpenVPN (https://openvpn.net/)
Running this on one of my Pi's. Free privacy, can't beat it.

> Pi-Hole (https://pi-hole.net/)
Sucks all the ads from my network 👋

> 🦆 DuckDNS (https://duckdns.org)
Forever free dynamic DNS. Using on the same Pi as above for my home network.

> OSMC (https://osmc.tv/)
Free, open source media center that's super flexible and extensible-- not to mention easy to use and nice design.

> Motion (https://github.com/Motion-Project/motion)
A really kickass motion sensor program. It can detect movement and then takes a snapshot and sends it to my phone. Useful for spying on the dog.

> Phillips Hue (http://www2.meethue.com/en-us/)
Purple lights, good API

> Nest Thermostat (https://nest.com/thermostat/meet-nest-thermostat/)
Great intuitive design, also good API
