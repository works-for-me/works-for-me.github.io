-- Frontend development

Core toolkit which helps me be productive and creative.
My laptop is MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015) with 2,5 GHz Intel Core i7 and 16GB of RAM.

> WebStorm (https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)

I switched from Sublime Text and completely happy with WebStorm's performance. Not to mention that the set of features is way better.

Refactoring feature saves me a lot of time every single day. Autocompletion is great, especially with statically-typed languages.

One of my must-have plugins is IdeaVim. I'm not a power vim-user but navigation and window-management with vim-shortcuts are much faster and, somehow, intuitive for me).

I work all the time in the "Distraction Free" mode, so I see only my code and everything else is called with shortcuts.

My font for a couple of years already is <Source Code Pro (https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro)>, could not find anything better yet.

> Bash-it (https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it)

Set of plugins and completions for your bash shell. Does not make your shell as fancy as would ZSH or Fish do, but brings it pretty close. As a bonus, you won't have any compatibility problems with any cli tools, which is the case sometimes with other shells.

My bash-it, along with other configs, you can find in my <.dotfiles (https://github.com/nik-garmash/.dotfiles)>


> iTerm 2 (https://www.iterm2.com/)

My second most used tool while working.
It has two features which stop me from switching to default macOS Terminal app:
• Select to copy — really handy to copy anything from terminal by just selecting it
• Cmd+click on a link to open it — very common case when developing web-applications

I have separate tab for each project and every tab has multiple splits.

> diff-so-fancy (https://github.com/so-fancy/diff-so-fancy)

A little tool which makes your git-diffs much more legible.


> HTTPie (https://github.com/jakubroztocil/httpie)

Another CLI tool, user-friendly curl-replacement. I just can't help to forget curl flags every time I use it 😁


> Sip (http://sipapp.io/)

Simple global color-picker which sits in the menu-bar.


> Sketch (https://www.sketchapp.com/)

Time after time I make mockups for my pet-projects and, at least for web-designs, Sketch fits really well.


> Docker (https://www.docker.com)

I like very much the idea of keeping development environment in some kind of self-contained boxes, so no matter how badly I mess up my system, projects are safe and ready to run.

Previously it was Vagrant, now it's container, as they are much more lightweight.

Also, I put into containers software which has dependencies I don't want to be in my host OS. E.g. something needs Python or Ruby or whatever — it goes to container, it's the nice way to keep your system clean.


-- Consuming information

That mostly happens on my elderly iPhone 5S.

> Reeder (http://reederapp.com), Feedly (http://feedly.com)

These two work in pair, Feedly manages RSS-subscriptions, and Reeder has really good UI for reading feeds (reading something directly in Feedly is a torture btw, don't do that)

Below, my most interesting subscriptions.

English:
• <Google developer platforms updates (https://developers.google.com/web/updates/)>
• <Practical Pixels — pixel-art lessons (https://medium.com/practical-pixels)>
• <Booking.com design blog (https://booking.design)>
• <Indie Hackers (https://www.indiehackers.com/businesses)>

Russian:
• <Блог Рахима Давлеткалиева (https://rakh.im)>
• <Блог Ильи Бирмана (http://ilyabirman.ru/meanwhile/)>
• <Бизнес-линч студии Лебедева (https://www.artlebedev.ru/kovodstvo/business-lynch/)>

• <Блог Антона Жиянова (https://antonz.ru)>
• <Блог Игоря Штанга (http://nobelfaik.livejournal.com)>
• <Блог Жени Арутюнова (http://bvz.name/blog/)>

Also I'm subscribe to my friends movie rates, IMDB has RSS build-in, really useful trick.


> Instapaper (https://www.instapaper.com/)

I have it installed on a phone and as an extension in a browser, very handy to save something for later reading with just one click.


> Tweetbot (http://tapbots.com/tweetbot/)

Besides some entertaining, Twitter for me is a source of programming-related articles which go to Instapaper. Tweetbot so far is the best client, at least because it shows everything in natural chronological order.


> Podcasts app

One of the main sources of information for me, not just technical, but in general, and some entertainment of course. I use native iOS Podcasts app. Podcasts are mostly in Russian but also few in English.

English:
• <Serial (https://serialpodcast.org)>
• <S-Town (https://stownpodcast.org)>
• <Stuff You Should Know (http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com)>

Russian:
• <Радио-Т (https://radio-t.com/)>
• <Веб-стандарты (https://itunes.apple.com/ru/podcast/veb-standarty/id1080500016)>
• <UWP — Еженедельный подкаст от Umputun (https://podcast.umputun.com)>
• <Evergreen Podcast (http://podtema.com)>
• <Хекслет (https://itunes.apple.com/fi/podcast/hekslet/id1162673070)>
• <Брендятина (http://radiomayak.ru/podcasts/podcast/id/45/)>


> Telegram (https://telegram.org/)

Despite it's a messenger, it has so-called Channels — thematic feeds, where people post short (mainly) news or thoughts, not cluttered like Twitter and one channel is dedicated to some specific topic.

You can find services which generate RSS-feed out of a channel, so you can read them in one place with your usual subscriptions.


-- Organizing myself

> Notes

For me it's always one note for one project, like a workspace, where I collect all todos, URLs, random notes with ideas, etc. Each project has a unique structure, which is very useful when it comes to a creative process of shaping some idea.


> 1Password (https://1password.com/)

Very nice app to store not only passwords but also documents, bank cards information and secret notes, all is encrypted and stored locally.
