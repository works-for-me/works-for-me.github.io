            <div class="description">
              <p class="description-paragraph">For a long time, I was strongly against "heavy" IDEs and was switching between different editors like Sublime Text, Atom, VSCode, etc. At some point, I realized I want more routine to be done for me so I could concentrate on more important stuff.</p>
              <p class="description-paragraph">At the second attempt, I finally switched to WebStorm and it's just awesome. It takes some time (a couple of weeks in my case) to get out of your comfort zone and learn new key-bindings, configure everything just like you want and wrap your head around some of the local concepts, but it's totally worth it.</p>
              <p class="description-paragraph">Refactoring feature ‚Äî one of the most underestimated be me in the past, it saves me a lot of time every single day. Rename a project-wide constant, rename a variable in scope, rename/move a file and refactor all imports, move function to another file ‚Äî ones of the most used.</p>
              <p class="description-paragraph">Autocompletion is great, especially with statically-typed languages.</p>
              <p class="description-paragraph">One of my must-have plugins is IdeaVim. I'm not a power vim-user but navigation and window-management with vim-shortcuts are much faster and, somehow, intuitive for me).</p>
              <p class="description-paragraph">I work all the time in "Distraction Free" mode, so I see only my code and everything else is done with shortcuts.</p>
              <p class="description-paragraph">My font for a couple of years already is "Source Code Pro", could not find anything better yet.</p>
              <p class="description-paragraph">If you are a web-developer, give WebStorm a try, it's fast, stable and being developed at a good pace.</p>

              <p class="description-paragraph">Bash-it does not cover all of the nice features in ZSH or Fish, but it covers a lot. It has good git-plugin to suggest your current branch and stuff like this, commands history, etc. All kinds of completions are there as well as different themes.</p>
              <p class="description-paragraph">You can find my bash-it along with other configs is in those

              <p class="description-paragraph">I very like the idea of keeping my development environment in some kind of self-contained boxes, so no matter what happens to my OS (I like to try some early betas of macOS) my projects are safe and ready to run.</p>
              <p class="description-paragraph">Previously it was Vagrant, now it's container, as they are much more lightweight.</p>
              <p class="description-paragraph">Also, I put into containers software which has dependencies I don't want to be in my host OS. E.g. something needs Python or Ruby or whatever ‚Äî it goes to a container, it's the nice way to keep your system clean.</p>
