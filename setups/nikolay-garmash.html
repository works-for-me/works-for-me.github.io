            <br>My laptop is MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015) with 2,5 GHz Intel Core i7 and 16GB of RAM.</div>

              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="description">For a long time, I was strongly against "heavy" IDEs and was switching between different editors like Sublime Text, Atom, VSCode, etc. At some point, I realized I want more routine to be done for me so I could concentrate on more important stuff.
              <br>
              <br>At the second attempt, I finally switched to WebStorm and it's just awesome. It takes some time (a couple of weeks in my case) to get out of your comfort zone and learn new key-bindings, configure everything just like you want and wrap your head around some of the local concepts, but it's totally worth it.
              <br>
              <br>Refactoring feature ‚Äî one of the most underestimated be me in the past, it saves me a lot of time every single day. Rename a project-wide constant, rename a variable in scope, rename/move a file and refactor all imports, move function to another file ‚Äî ones of the most used.
              <br>
              <br>Autocompletion is great, especially with statically-typed languages.
              <br>
              <br>One of my must-have plugins is IdeaVim. I'm not a power vim-user but navigation and window-management with vim-shortcuts are much faster and, somehow, intuitive for me).
              <br>
              <br>I work all the time in "Distraction Free" mode, so I see only my code and everything else is done with shortcuts.
              <br>
              <br>My font for a couple of years already is "Source Code Pro", could not find anything better yet.
              <br>
              <br>If you are a web-developer, give WebStorm a try, it's fast, stable and being developed at a good pace.</div>

              <br>I've tried ZSH and Fish-shell (latter is super nice btw) but often those shells were a problem for third-party applications which was written with the thought that bash is the only possible shell in the universe.
              <br>
              <br>Bash-it does not cover all of the nice features in ZSH or Fish, but it covers a lot. It has good git-plugin to suggest your current branch and stuff like this, commands history, etc. All kinds of completions are there as well as different themes.</div>

            <div class="description">I very like the idea of keeping my development environment in some kind of self-contained boxes, so no matter what happens to my OS (I like to try some early betas of macOS) my projects are safe and ready to run.
              <br>
              <br>Previously it was Vagrant, now it's container, as they are much more lightweight.
              <br>
              <br>Also, I put into containers software which has dependencies I don't want to be in my host OS. E.g. something needs Python or Ruby or whatever ‚Äî it goes to a container, it's the nice way to keep your system clean.</div>

              <br>The standard Notes app in macOS fits this task perfectly, it's just a bunch of text files with some flavor like checkboxes and simple formatting.
              <br>
              <br>For me, it's always one note for one project where I collect all todos, URLs to some resources, random notes with ideas, etc. Each project has its own workspace with a unique structure, which is very useful when it comes to a creative process of shaping some idea.</div>
